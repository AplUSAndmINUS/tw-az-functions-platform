# Azure Authentication Updates

## Changes Made

The authentication code in `BlobStorageService.cs` and `TableStorageService.cs` has been updated to address deprecation warnings related to `ExcludeVisualStudioCodeCredential`.

### Previous Implementation

```csharp
var options = new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions
{
    ManagedIdentityClientId = clientId, // Only set when using user-assigned managed identity
    ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential = true,
    ExcludeVisualStudioCredential = true,
    ExcludeVisualStudioCodeCredential = true // This is now deprecated
};
```

### New Implementation

```csharp
var options = new DefaultAzureCredentialOptions
{
    ManagedIdentityClientId = clientId, // Only set when using user-assigned managed identity
    ExcludeSharedTokenCacheCredential = true,
    ExcludeVisualStudioCredential = true,
    // Modern approach: Include only the credentials we need instead of excluding ones we don't
    ExcludeAzureCliCredential = false,
    ExcludeManagedIdentityCredential = false,
    ExcludeEnvironmentCredential = false,
    // All other credential types are excluded by default
    DisableInstanceDiscovery = true // Improves performance by avoiding AAD instance discovery
};
```

## Reasoning Behind Changes

1. **Removal of Deprecated Code**: The `ExcludeVisualStudioCodeCredential` option has been deprecated because the VS Code Azure Account extension it relies on has been deprecated.

2. **Modern Approach**: Instead of excluding specific credential types, we now explicitly include only the credential types we need:
   - `ManagedIdentityCredential` - For Azure-hosted environments
   - `EnvironmentCredential` - For environment variable-based authentication
   - `AzureCliCredential` - For local development using Azure CLI

3. **Performance Optimization**: Added `DisableInstanceDiscovery = true` to improve performance by avoiding Azure AD instance discovery when not needed.

## Benefits

1. **No More Warnings**: Eliminates the deprecation warnings during build
2. **Better Performance**: The new approach is more efficient
3. **Clearer Intent**: Code now explicitly shows which credential types are being used
4. **Forward Compatible**: Uses the recommended approach by the Azure SDK team

## Authentication Flow

The credential chain will now try these authentication methods in this order:

1. `EnvironmentCredential`: Checks for environment variables like `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, etc.
2. `ManagedIdentityCredential`: Uses managed identity when running in Azure
3. `AzureCliCredential`: Uses credentials from Azure CLI when developing locally

This ensures a smooth authentication experience across different environments while avoiding the deprecated VS Code credential.
